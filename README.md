# Show Me The Data Structures
There are six different data structure problems in this project.
1. LRU Cache(/LRU_Cache)
2. Finding Files(/FindingFiles)
3. Huffman Coding(/HuffmanCoding)
4. Active Directory(/ActiveDirectory)
5. Blockchain(/Blockchain)
6. Union Intersection(/UnionIntersection)

In Each directory, there are two files
1. Code file (_*.py_)
2. Description (_*.md_)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run
1. LRU Cache: `python LRU_Cache/LRU_Cache.py`
2. Finding Files: `python FindingFiles/FindingFiles.py`
3. Huffman Coding: `python HuffmanCoding/HuffmanCoding.py`
4. Active Directory: `python ActiveDirectory/ActiveDirectory.py`
5. Blockchain: `python Blockchain/Blockchain.py`
6. Union Intersection: `python UnionIntersection/UnionIntersection.py`

Thank you Udacity for this opportunity.
