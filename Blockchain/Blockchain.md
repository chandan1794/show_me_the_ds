# Blockchain
### Data Structure
I used **Singly LinkedList** as **Blockchain**.

### Complexity for data structures
- Singly LinkedList With Head and Tail Pointers
    - Insert: O(1)
    - Space:  O(n)

### Complexity of the implemented Data Structure
   - add_block:     O(1)
   - Space:         O(n)

### Reasoning
In the name of Blockchain, there is "chain", which means connected linearly.
There are two data structures which are linear and works well.
a. Array
b. LinkedList

I chose LinkedList for two reasons
1. It was mentioned in the project to use it.
2. There is no contiguous space requirement as needed for Array.
